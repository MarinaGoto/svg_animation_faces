# svg_animation_faces
If you ever wondered how you can animate your illustrations, this workshop is for you. 
Together we will create an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) Animation of an object and make it alive using CSS and JavaScript. 
It has never been more simple. Yet having that skill will allow you to take your next web development projects to a whole new level!
